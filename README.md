# fvmic2d

This is an implementation of a conservative finite difference plus marker-in-cell code, closely following Gerya and Yuen (2003) and Gerya and Yuen (2007).
The code requires PETSc, and likely will not work with current PETSc versions without some updates.

A version of this code was used in:

Rudolph, M. L., and Manga, M. (2012), Effects of anisotropic viscosity and texture development on convection in ice mantles, *J. Geophys. Res.*, 117, E11003, doi:10.1029/2012JE004166.

The code is provided as-is with no warranty.
